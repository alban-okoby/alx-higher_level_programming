## Background context
<p>The AirBnB project is a big part of the Higher level curriculum. This project will help you be ready for it.
<br>
In this project, you will review everything about Python:
</p>
- Import
- Exceptions
- Class
- Private attribute
- Getter/Setter
- Class method
- Static method
- Inheritance
- Unittest
- Read/Write file
- You will also learn about:
<br>
- args and kwargs
- Serialization/Deserialization
- JSON.

## General 
- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class
- How to write and read a JSON file
- What is *args and how to use it
- What is **kwargs and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function.

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it‚Äôs a real sentence explaining what‚Äôs the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don‚Äôt miss any edge case.

## Documentation
- Do not use the words import or from inside your comments, the checker will think you try to import some modules

<br> Have happy coding ÔøΩ <br>
